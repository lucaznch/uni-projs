### Analysis and Synthesis of Algorithms

Contains three individual projects. Each project applies key concepts such as sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, and data structures like trees, graphs, and hash tables. The problems are similar in style to those found on platforms like LeetCode and are designed to reinforce both theoretical understanding and practical implementation skills:

- [p1](p1/)

- [p2](p2/)

- [p3](p3/)
