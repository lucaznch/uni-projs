# Artificial Intelligence Project 2023/2024


## 1. Introduction
The Artificial Intelligence curricular unit project aims to develop a program in Python 3.8 that solves an adaptation of the *Pipe Mania* problem using Artificial Intelligence search and problem-solving techniques.


The game *Pipe Mania* is a puzzle game developed in 1989 by The Assembly Line for the Amiga computer.


It was later adapted for several other platforms by Lucasfilm Games, which gave it the name "Pipe Dream".


The objective of the game is to build a functional plumbing system to prevent water leaks.
